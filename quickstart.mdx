2. Choose from the available templates:
   - **Knowledge AI Agent** – Connect documents, URLs, and files to answer team queries
   - **Co-browsing AI Agent** – Build in-app walkthroughs for users
   - **Robotic Automation Agent** – Automate repetitive UI tasks with no code

3. Click **Create** under the agent you want to try
4. Follow the on-screen setup instructions (most templates work out of the box)

Once deployed, your agent will appear in the “AI Agents” section, where you can monitor, edit, and run it.
