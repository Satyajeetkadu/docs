## Step-by-step: Creating a Process Discovery AI Agent

### 1. **Select the Agent Type**

On the dashboard, click **Create AI Agent** and select the **Process Discovery AI Agent** option.

### 2. **Name Your Agent**

- Add a meaningful title and optional description.
- Example: “Invoice Workflow Analysis” or “Sales CRM Process Capture”

## Process Discovery Agent: Workspace Overview

Once your **Process Discovery AI Agent** is created, you’re taken to an intuitive **workflow dashboard** where the recorded actions and analysis are displayed.

Here’s a breakdown of what each section and element represents:

### **Center Workflow Panel (Main Canvas)**

This is where your **step-by-step process flow** is visualized.

- **Start Node (Green)**
  - Marks the beginning of your process.
- **Show Block**
  - Indicates a recorded step. For example:\
    `Click on Start button to initiate Web/Desktop show process`.
- **End Node (Red)**
  - Marks the completion of the current workflow.
- ➕ **Add Step Buttons**
  - Located between steps. Click these to **insert new skills** like:
    - `Read Table`, `Loop`, `Excel`, `Hover`, `OCR`, `Message Box`, etc.
  - This lets you **extend or convert the discovery into an automation**.

### **Left Panel (Process Variants)**

This panel shows insights collected across user recordings:

- **Variant ID** – Unique process variation identifier.
- **Email** – Who performed the task.
- **Apps Involved** – Web or desktop apps used.

⚠️ If this shows `No data`, it means no variants have been recorded yet.

### **Top Navigation**

- **Aggregate**
  - Groups and visualizes similar variants across users.
- **Compare**
  - Highlights differences between multiple process executions (ideal for spotting inefficiencies).
- **Start Show**
  - Reopens the screen recorder to capture a new user session.
- **Save**
  - Saves your current version of the workflow.

### Summary Use Case

This workspace allows you to:

- Visually analyze recorded workflows.
- Identify what steps users take.
- Discover hidden inefficiencies or opportunities for automation.
- Convert any discovered flow into a **Robotic Automation Agent**.
