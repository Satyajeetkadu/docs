## Step-by-step: Creating a Workflow AI Agent

### 1. **Select the Agent Type**

On the dashboard, click **Create AI Agent** and select the **Workflow AI Agent** option.

### 2. **Name and Describe the Agent**

- Choose **Create from scratch** or **Import from JSON**
- Enter a meaningful name for your agent (e.g., “Customer Onboarding Flow”)
- Add a short description of the agent’s purpose

Click **Next** to continue.

### 3. **Design Your Workflow**

Once inside the editor:

- You’ll see a simple **Start → Automation Skill → End** flow preloaded.
- Use the **\+ Add Step** button to insert additional steps (skills) into the process.
- You can configure each step by typing prompts (e.g., “Send welcome email to new user” or “Ask manager to approve document”).

The AI will translate your intent into actionable steps in the flow.

### 4. **Chat with Supervity AI Coach**

The built-in **Supervity AI Coach** helps you iterate, modify, or generate new steps via chat. You can:

- Ask for help with automation logic
- Generate new steps via natural language
