## Step-by-step: Creating a Knowledge AI Agent

### 1. **Select the Agent Type**

On the dashboard, click **Create AI Agent** and select the **Knowledge AI Agent** option.

### 2. **Set Collection Type**

- Choose from:
  - `Unstructured Data (Files)`
    - Users can upload documents (PDFs, PPTs, Word, spreadsheets, audio, video) to extract valuable insights using advanced AI, enabling accurate, context-rich responses. This seamlessly integrates unstructured data into workflows, helping users and businesses gain actionable insights.
  - `Database`
    - Connects to databases to retrieve relevant data and generate natural language, context-aware responses, simplifying complex queries and improving exploration.
  - `Live Search`
    - Fetches real-time data from dynamic websites to provide accurate, up-to-date responses to user queries. By integrating live sources, it ensures answers reflect the most current and relevant information available.
  - `Transcribe`
    - Uses advanced speech-to-text technology to convert audio and video into text while analyzing it for context, key insights, and relevant information.

### 3. **Fill in Details**

- Add a collection name and description
- Choose the base language and model (e.g. GPT-4o)
- Click **Create**

### 4. Upload Knowledge Sources

Once your collection is created, you can upload:

- **Files** (PDF, PPTX, Word, Excel, audio, video) from local device, Google Drive, or SharePoint
- **URLs** (scrape individual pages or full websites)
- **Text snippets** manually

Use OCR if needed for image-based documents.

### 5. Set Guardrails

Under the **Guardrails** tab, configure:

- **System Prompt** (instructions for the agent)
- **Pre-processing instructions**
- **Additional logic or fallback flows**
- **Co-browsing agent integration** (if applicable)

### 6. Interact with Your Knowledge Agent

Go to the **Ask AI Agent** tab to start asking questions directly based on the uploaded content. You can toggle **Chat Context** for multi-turn memory.

## Access from Sidebar

Once created, all your Knowledge AI Agents and collections are accessible from the **AI Knowledge** tab in the left sidebar. Here, you can:

- View all your collections
- Edit or delete them
- Add new documents or sources

## Integration as Web Chat Bot

By clicking the **three-dot menu** (︙) on any collection card under **AI Knowledge**, and selecting **Integration**, you can:

- **Embed a conversational AI bot** into your website or portal
- Copy the pre-generated JavaScript snippet
- Customize appearance and behavior with query parameters\
  (e.g., `&chatFontSize=20px`, `&chatBackgroundColor=%23fd2000`)

This allows your customers or team to chat with the Knowledge Agent using a branded interface on your site.
