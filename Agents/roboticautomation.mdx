### RAAs streamline daily workflows like:

- Filling web forms
- Moving data between spreadsheets and apps
- Sending automated emails
- Switching between desktop applications
- Extracting and processing data using AI

## Types of Robotic Automation Agents

There are **three types** of RAAs you can create, each tailored to specific automation use cases:

1. **Web AI Agent**
   - Automates repetitive tasks across web applications.
   - Use it to capture and replay actions like logging in, form submission, clicking buttons, etc.

   **Use case:** Filling out HR onboarding forms on internal portals.
2. **Data Entry AI Agent**
   - Designed to import data from spreadsheets into any web app.
   - You demonstrate just one row of entry, and the AI does the rest.

   **Use case:** Uploading bulk leads into a CRM system from Excel.
3. **Create Your Own (from Scratch)**
   - A flexible automation builder for both web and desktop tasks.
   - Choose from a wide range of steps like loops, app controls, file operations, API calls, and more.

   **Use case:** Automating a desktop-to-web process involving screenshots, Excel, and email.

## Step-by-step: Creating a Robotic Automation AI Agent

### 1. Navigate to AI Agent Creation

- From the Supervity dashboard, click on the **“Create AI Agent”** button on the left sidebar.

### 2. Choose Robotic Automation AI Agent

- You’ll see different AI agent templates.
- Select **“Robotic Automation AI Agent”** from the list.

### 3. Choose Template or Start from Scratch
