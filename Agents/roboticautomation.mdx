### You can choose between two types:

- **Web Co-Browsing AI Agent**: Ideal for in-browser guidance across SaaS platforms or websites.
- **Desktop Co-Browsing AI Agent**: Tailored for desktop-based applications and automations, equivalent to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with powerful show-and-tell features.

With no-code creation, rich UI-based scripting, and integrated AI capabilities, Co-Browsing Agents enable seamless digital enablement for your team or customers — without needing developers to hardcode anything.
