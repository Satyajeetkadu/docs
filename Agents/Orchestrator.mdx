description: "Orchestrator Agents in Supervity are advanced multi-agent AI workflows designed to solve complex business problems end-to-end. "

They coordinate multiple specialized AI agents (called **Operator Agents**) to manage large-scale, domain-specific processes like:

- **Accounts Payable Automation**
- **Procurement Lifecycle Management**
- **HR Talent Acquisition**
- **Contract Intelligence and Legal Operations**

Each orchestrator acts like a mission control system, dynamically triggering and managing other AI agents, routing data, handling exceptions, and interacting with both humans and systems.

## How Orchestrator Agents Work

Orchestrator Agents use a **Workflow AI Agent template**, enhanced with logic blocks, skills, and agent invocation capabilities. They:

1. **Monitor input sources** (emails, documents, portals, chatbots)
2. **Detect user intent** using NLP models or keyword mapping
3. **Trigger specialized AI agents** based on the detected task
4. **Route outputs and decisions** across steps like approvals, escalations, and updates
5. **Track status across all subprocesses**
6. **Generate consolidated reports**

All Orchestrator workflows are built using a visual drag-and-drop editor, and support **human-in-the-loop**, **multi-channel triggers**, and **real-time feedback capture**.
